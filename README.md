# NGS Variant Calling Pipeline

A comprehensive, modular pipeline for calling variants from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. This pipeline streamlines the analysis from raw sequencing reads to annotated variant calls, making it easier to integrate into your bioinformatics workflows.

## Overview

The NGS Variant Calling Pipeline automates the key steps in variant analysis, including:

- **Quality Control:** Assessing raw read quality (e.g., using FastQC).
- **Read Alignment:** Mapping reads to a reference genome (e.g., using BWA or Bowtie).
- **Post-processing:** Sorting, indexing, and marking duplicates (e.g., with Samtools and Picard).
- **Variant Calling:** Identifying single nucleotide variants and indels (e.g., using GATK or FreeBayes).
- **Annotation:** Adding biological context to identified variants (e.g., using GATK).

This pipeline is designed with modularity and reproducibility in mind, allowing you to easily customize and extend its functionality.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily swap out or add tools based on your analysis needs.
- **Automation:** Provides end-to-end processing from raw data to annotated variant reports.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for both small-scale projects and large-scale studies.
- **Reproducibility:** Uses configuration files and version control to ensure that analyses can be replicated.

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux-based systems (tested on Ubuntu)
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.6 or higher
